Twinnable Many to Many
######################

The ``twinnable_many_many`` relation is the equivalent of the FuelPHP native ``many_many`` relation (moreover, it extends ``many_many``).
The difference is that the link is not made on primary keys but on context common IDs.

If you use the ``twinnable_many_many`` relation, the model and the model linked must implement :doc:`Twinnable behaviour </php/behaviours/twinnable>`.

.. seealso::

    * :doc:`Twinnable behaviour </php/behaviours/twinnable>`
    * :doc:`/php/configuration/software/multi_context`.
    * `FuelPHP native many_many <http://fuelphp.com/docs/packages/orm/relations/many_many.html>`__
