.. _php/configuration/application/appdesk/data_mapping:

data_mapping
************

Associative or simple array. Defines which data_mapping items from :doc:`common` configuration we display (mostly filtering).

Is is also possible to define new custom data_mapping items which will be only used on the appdesk.

If only value is defined, appdesk will display the data_mapping item from common configuration.

If it is a key => value association (value must then be an array), then the data_mapping item from common configuration is extended by the value.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    return array(
        // ...
        'data_mapping '=> array(
            'col1', // will display the col1 data_mapping item from common configuration.
            'col2' => array( // if col2 exists on common configuration data_mapping key then it is extended ; otherwise, the item is added to appdesk.
                // ...
            ),
        ),
    );

inspectors
**********

Associative or simple array. Defines which inspectors are used on appdesk.

If is also possible to define new custom inspectors which will be only used on the appdesk.

If only value is defined:
* appdesk will display the inspector located at `inspector/inspector_name` if the value is `inspector_name`.
* it also supports inspector class names (`\My\App\Controller_Admin_Inspector_Name`).

If it is a key => value association (value must then be an array), then the inspector configuration is extended by the value.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    return array(
        // ...
        'inspectors '=> array(
            'inspector1', // will display the inspector located at inspector/inspector1.
            '\My\App\Controller_Admin_Inspector_Name', // will display the inspector which class is \My\App\Controller_Admin_Inspector_Name
            'inspector2' => array( // if inspector/inspector2 exists, then it is extended ; otherwise it creates a new inspector
                // ...
            ),
        ),
    );

            },
